## Abstract

Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics focused on the study of discrete objects and their arrangements. It deals with counting, enumerating, and analyzing configurations of objects that can be distinct or identical, finite or infinite, and arranged in various ways. Over the years as this field of mathematics has matured it has become exceedingly harder to provide purely combinatorial arguments for the questions that continue to arise. Thus, there has been a need to introduce the interplay of combinatorics with various methods ranging from algebraic to analytic to probabilistic. In this UDGRP, we will mainly be focusing on the algebraic and geometric methods, and at times, may call upon some probabilistic methods, if necessary.

**Day 2: An insight into Geometric and Topological Combinatorics**

This was the second session of the Enumerative Combinatorics UDGRP. We used the time to introduce some areas in geometric and topological combinatorics, and also provide a brief introduction to additive combinatorics. For further reading, look into the books in the reference.
