I'm a 21 year old guy from a town named Burdwan in West Bengal, India. Currently, I'm a M.Math student at Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore. My mathematical interests lie in graph theory and combinatorics. You can find more about my academic background [here](/cv/).

Keeping aside my academics, I am an avid reader, in love with mystery thriller and science fiction books. So, if you have book suggestions for me, do not hesitate to drop me an email, or a text on instagram. I have an interest in dramas, anime, and movies too, so those suggestions are also welcome. Adding to these, I love long bicycle rides and rock music (especially, bengali rock).

Recently, while being in Indian Statistical Institue, Bangalore, I have picked up two interests. I play "Genshin Impact", an action role-playing game, with a very engaging story. So, if you are a fellow Genshin player, drop me a message and maybe we can play in co-op. The other interest I picked up is playing various card games.
