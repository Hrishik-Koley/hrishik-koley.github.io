I'm a 20 year old guy from a town named Burdwan in West Bengal, India. Currently, I'm a second year undergraduate student in mathematics at Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore. My mathematical interests lie in graph theory and combinatorics, more specifically, probabilistic and algebraic combinatorics. You can find more about my academic background [here](/cv/), or if you want a more fun way to find out about my academic background, then check out this, where I have integrated my CV in a terminal window. 

Keeping aside my academics, I am an avid reader, in love with mystery thriller and science fiction books. So, if you have book suggestions for me, do not hesitate to drop me an email, or a text on instagram. I have an interest in dramas and have took part in many a plays, both in school and college. Adding to these, I love long bicycle rides and rock music (especially, bengali rock).

Recently, while being in Indian Statistical Institue, Bangalore, I have picked up two interests. I play "Genshin Impact", an action role-playing game, with a very engaging story. So, if you are a fellow Genshin player, drop me a message and maybe we can play in co-op. The other interest I picked up is playing a card game, called Literature.
