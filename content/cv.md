**Algebraic Combinatorics and Tilings**
As a part of this project I started with exploring various topics in algebraic combinatorics but soon focused my attention on the theory of tilings. I studied extensively about rectangular tilings, honeycomb tilings, and benzel tilings. Later, I also studied about fault-free tilings.

| **Structural Graph Theory** |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| I did a project on _Structural Graph Thoery_ under _Prof. Nishad Kothari_ in online mode, where I studied various advanced graph theoretic concepts in depth from the book "_Garph Theory_" by _Bondy & Murty_ and later went on to cover deeper results in _Matching Theory_ from the book "_Matching Theory_" by _Lovasz & Plummer_. | May-Jul 2024 |

| **Hanoi Graphs, Sierpinski Graphs, and Sierpinski Triangle Graphs** |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| I did a project under _Dr. Divya Sindhu Lekha_ in hybrid mode at _IIIT Kottayam_, where I followed the book "_The Tower of Hanoi - Myths and Maths_" and read through some survey and research papers related to graph theory and Tower of Hanoi. I wrote a report and then we tried to find out the "_Median of Sierpinski Triangle Graphs_", which has now culminated in a research paper. | Jun-Aug 2023 |

| **On the Relationship of Emotional Intelligence and Group Work Results of University Students** |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| This was a group project done as a part of my Statistics-I course under the guidance of _Professor Rituparna Sen_ at _ISI, Bangalore_. We read a paper and wrote a report on it as well as extended it's results. | Jan-Apr 2023 |
